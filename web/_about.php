							During the 9th Japan-Thailand Joint Trade and Economic Committee Meeting held in Kobe, Japan in 1989, the delegates from the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren – now Nippon Keidanren) and the Federation of Thai Industries (FTI) realized that in order to enhance industrial development of Thailand, engineering programs, where all lecture and laboratory courses would be taught in English by highly qualified faculty members with doctoral degrees, needed to be established.

			A cooperation agreement among Keidanren, FTI, and Thammasat University was reached in 1992 to establish bachelor degree programs in engineering at Thammasat University with initial funds provided by Keidanren and FTI. After two years of successful operation, the "International Institute of Technology (IIT)" was founded on September 16, 1994. Her Royal Highness Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn graciously presided over the Cornerstone Laying Ceremony of a new building at the Rangsit Campus of Thammasat University, using part of the initial fund for the construction. His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand graciously granted the Institute a new name, “Sirindhorn International Institute of Technology (SIIT)”, on June 28, 1996. 

			On October 2, 1997, Her Royal Highness Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn graciously presided over the Sirindhorn International Institute of Technology’s Inauguration Ceremony of its name and building. In 1999, FTI provided a parcel of land with an existing building at Bangkadi Industrial Park (BKD) for SIIT’s use for 30 years. In June 2001, the former Prime Minister Anand Panyarachun inaugurated a new building at Bangkadi for Information Technology and Computer Science programs. 

			Her Royal Highness Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn graciously presided over the inauguration of the Sirindhralai Building at Bangkadi on June 28, 2006. This new six-storey building houses the Electronics and Communication Engineering, Engineering Management, and Management Technology programs, a library, a computer center, laboratories and classrooms. 
			
			Backgrounds of the three founding organizations of Sirindhorn International Institute of Technology are briefly described as follows.
